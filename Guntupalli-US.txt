As a student studying for an exam, I want to block all social media and any non-academic related websites, so that I can increase my productivity.  As an employee who works from home, I want to schedule block sessions that will deter unwanted notifications and only allow work related information to come through for specific periods of time, so that I can stay focused on work. As a teacher, I want to hook up my laptop to project examples to the class without receiving notifications of any kind, so that the class will not get distracted or no personal information of mine will pop up on the screen.
