1.	As a parent who works from home,
I want to set a work mode that blocks my personal messages,
So that I can prevent distractions when I am supposed to be accomplishing work.

2.	As a college student,
I want to turn on a focus mode to block my choice of social media sites for a specified period of time,
So that I can focus when writing papers in large chunks of times.

3.	As a lecturer,
I want to set a work mode that blocks my choice of websites and notifications,
So that I do not have notifications pop up when displaying my screen in front of my class.
