As a mother,
I want to block gaming and social media sites from my child's computer during study hours,
so that I can be sure they aren't messing around.

As a user,
I want to be able to see how long I've used certain websites in a day,
so that I can try to avoid going on for too long.

As a parent,
I want to perpetually block inappropriate sites,
so that my children cannot access them.
